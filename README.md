# 5E Ranch

## Summary
A mock site for a ranch built with Next.js, Mapbox API, Tailwind CSS, and Contentful CMS. Integrated Stripe Checkout (in test mode) for product sales and implemented webhooks to manage post-purchase workflows. The project served as a playground for experimenting with modern CMS and payment processing integrations. 

## To make a mock purchase:
- Add something to the cart
- Use one of these [test cards](https://docs.stripe.com/testing#cards) when checking out
- Submit purchase
